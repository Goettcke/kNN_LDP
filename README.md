# kNN_LDP
This repository contains the implementation of the kNN_LDP algorithm from the paper *Non-Parametric Semi-Supervised Learning by Bayesian Label Distribution Propagation* by Jonatan M. N. GÃ¸ttcke and A. Zimek.
The paper is presented at the *14th International Conference on
Similarity Search and Applications*, **SISAP 2021**. 

The implementation follows the Scikit-learn classifier style which most users are familiar with. 
## Using the implementation 
1. Git clone the repository. 
2. Ensure you have Python 3.8.+ installed 
3. Install the required dependencies
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. Try the example
    ```bash
    python example.py
    ```


See the example.py file on how to use the implementation in further detail.
